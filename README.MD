# Health Analysis

Health Analysis is a data science project aimed at analyzing health-related data using various machine learning and data analysis techniques. The project is organized into different directories to manage data, code, and models effectively. This README provides an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to navigate through the different components.

## Project Structure

```
- Health Analysis
  |- data
  |  |- raw
  |  |- processed
  |
  |- models
  |
  |- src
     |- modules
     |
     |- utils
```

### Description of Directories

- **data**: This directory contains health-related data used for analysis. The `raw` subdirectory is intended for storing raw, unprocessed data, while the `processed` subdirectory holds cleaned and preprocessed data ready for analysis.

- **models**: This directory stores trained machine learning models resulting from the analysis.

- **src**: The source code for the project is located in this directory.

  - **modules**: Each subdirectory within `modules` corresponds to a specific health-related problem or analysis. Each module contains code files related to solving that particular problem.

  - **utils**: This directory contains utility functions, helper scripts, and common functionalities used across different modules.

## Getting Started

To start working with the Health Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JR-Camacho/health_analysis.git
   cd health_analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the data:

   - The `raw` folder within the `data` directory contains the raw, unprocessed health-related data.
   - The `processed` folder within the `data` directory contains the cleaned and preprocessed data ready for analysis.
